Q5. In a for loop, and can be statements more complicated than declaring, initializing, and updating a loop-control variable. 
How can I take advantage of this ability?

The logical operator && can be used to give two condition statements in for loop.
 condition1 && condition2
 This returns true if both the conditions are true.
 
 Example:

for (int i = 0, j = 10; i <= 10 && j > 0; i++, j--) {
     System.out.println("Inside For Loop");
 }
