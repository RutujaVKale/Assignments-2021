i++ is called the post increment operator where the value of variable i is used first and then incremented 
by 1
Eg: If i=7 
	a=i++ will assign the value as 7 to a

++i is called as the pre increment operator where the value of variable i is incremented by one first and then 
used in the expression 

Eg: If i=7
	a=++i will assign the value as 8 to a

Both the operators are unary operators that is operate on a single operand.
