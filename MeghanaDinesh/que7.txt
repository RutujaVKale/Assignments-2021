All for loops can be converted to while loops and vice versa.
Both for loop and while loop are entry controlled loops which means the test expressions are validated first 
and then if it validates to true only the body of the loop gets executed.
Eg: Consider the for loop as shown:
for(int i=0;i<5;i++)
	System.out.println(i);
is equiuvalent to the while loop shown below:
int i=0;
while(i<5)
{	
	System.out.println(i);
	i++;
}
