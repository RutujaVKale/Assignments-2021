Yes double values can be used in for loops.
It is mainly used in case where there is requirement of incrementing the loop variable by fraction and not 
by whole numbers.

For instance, consider
public class que6
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        for(double i=1.2;i<3.4;i=i+0.5)
            System.out.println(i);
    }
}

would produce the output as:
1.2
1.7
2.2
2.7
3.2
