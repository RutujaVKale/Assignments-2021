It's absolutely correct to do, especially if you want to loop through fractional values or increment by fractional values.

But for certain conditions, which is that if we employ this technique, do not compare with == for the condition to end the loop. Due to precision errors, this can easily result in an infinite loop in spite of the best intentions. That's why we always uses <=.
