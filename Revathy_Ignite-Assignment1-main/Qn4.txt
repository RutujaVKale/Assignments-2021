++i and i++ both increment the value of i by 1 but in a different way. If ++ precedes the variable, it is called pre-increment operator and it comes after a variable, it is called post-increment operator.

Increment in java is performed in two ways,

1) Post-Increment (i++): we use i++ in our statement if we want to use the current value, and then we want to increment the value of i by 1.

2) Pre-Increment(++i): We use ++i in our statement if we want to increment the value of i by 1 and then use it in our statement.
