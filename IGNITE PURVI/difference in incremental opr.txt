++i and i++ both increment the value of i by 1 but in a different way.


1) Post-Increment (i++): we use i++ in our statement if we want to use the current value, and then we want to increment the value of i by 1.

2) Pre-Increment(++i): We use ++i in our statement if we want to increment the value of i by 1 and then use it in our statement.
