Q7 . Are there cases where I must use a for loop but not a while, or vice versa?

answer:
Every for loop can be written as a while loop and vice versa so there are no cases where it is a must to use only a
for loop and not a while loop or vice versa.

for loop is used when we know exactly how the loop will work and the number of iterations whereas,
while loop is used when the the condition of execution is known but not the number of iterations.

example:
public class question7 {
    public static void main(String args[]){
          int[] num = new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4};
        //printing the elements with for loop
        for(int i=0;i<4;i++)
        {
        System.out.println(num[i]);
        }

        //printing the elements with while loop
        int j=0;
        while(j<4){
            System.out.println(num[j]);
            j++;
        }
    }
}
