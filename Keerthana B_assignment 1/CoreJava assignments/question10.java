/*Write a program GreatestCommonDivisor that finds the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two integers using
Euclidâ€™s algorithm, which is an iterative computation based on the following observation: if x is
greater than y, then if y divides x, the gcd of x and y is y;
otherwise, the gcd of x and y is the same as the gcd of x % y and y.
