Q6 Can I use a double variable as a loop-control variable in a for loop?

answer:
Yes, a double variable can be used as a loop-control variable in a for loop, usually used if we want to loop
through fractional values or increment by fractional values.

example:
public class question6 {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        for(double num=0; num<5; num=num+0.115 ){
            //increment by fractional value
            System.out.println(num);
        }
    }
}
