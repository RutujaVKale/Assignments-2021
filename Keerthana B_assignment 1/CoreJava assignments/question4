Q. What is the difference between ++i and i++?

answer:
Both increment the value of variable i by 1. But, ++i is pre-increment whereas i++ is post-increment. This means that,
pre-increment(++i) - increments the value of i first and then uses it in execution
post-increment(i++) - uses the existing value of i first and then increments the value of i by 1 for next use.

example:
int num = 5;
int a = num++; // a = 5, num = 6
int b = ++a; // b = 7, a = 7
