Q.In a for loop, and can be statements more complicated than declaring,
initializing, and updating a loop-control variable. How can I take advantage of this ability?

answer:
the syntax for a for loop is given as,
for ( variable initialization; condition; variable update )
    {
     block of statements
     }


We can use logical operators to validate more than one expression in a single loop.
For instance, we can combine multiple conditions using and (&&) operator. In this case, the for loop runs as long as both the conditions hold true.
example:
for (int a = 1, b = 7; a < 5 && b < 9; a++ , b++) {
     System.out.println("executing the loop " + a + "th time");
}

Similarly, we can combine multiple conditions using or (||) operator. In this case, the for loop runs as long as either of the conditions holds true.
example:
for (int a = 1, b = 7; a < 5 || b < 9; a++ , b++) {
     System.out.println("executing the loop " + a + "th time");
}
